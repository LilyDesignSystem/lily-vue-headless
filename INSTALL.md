# Install

This repository is the Vue 3 headless component library: all 491 catalog components, unstyled and accessible.

It is published as a `git subtree` from the canonical Lily Design System™
monorepo at <https://github.com/LilyDesignSystem/lily-design-system>. Issues and pull requests are handled there.

Full documentation and the searchable component catalog: <https://lilydesignsystem.github.io/>

## Install

```sh
npm install lily-design-system-vue-headless
```

Import any of the 491 catalog components from the package root; the barrel is
tree-shakeable (`sideEffects: false`), so your bundler drops what you do not use.

The components ship semantic HTML, ARIA, focus management, and keyboard
behaviour — and **no CSS**. Style them through the kebab-case class hook on each
root element. See the canonical
[css-style-sheet-template.css](https://github.com/LilyDesignSystem/lily-design-system/blob/main/css-style-sheet-template.css)
for a hook per component, and the 45 ready-made stylesheets in
[themes/](https://github.com/LilyDesignSystem/lily-design-system/tree/main/themes).
